      <p className="text-xl mt-5 px-5"> I love to volunteer  and learn new languages, especially japanese. Volunteering outside school would enhance my civic responsibility and make me stand outside of my comfort zone.Learning a new linguistic not only gives me the ability to experience its  culture, but also makes me know a diverse way of thinking, and it is helpful in dealing with Tech problems.

<p className="text-xl mt-5 px-5"> After 3 years of learning Japanese, I finally won the special prize of the Ottawa Japanese Speech Competition!  Standing on stage is a very nervous thing, however every time I think that I can share my best side and best ideas with others, my nervousness disappears. I have attached my speech contest video below, I would love to share my ideas with everyone!</p>
